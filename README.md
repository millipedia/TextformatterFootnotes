Processwire textformatter for pulling out footnotes

This is a quick textformatter for pulling out footnotes from a content block.

Any text marked up with double square brackets [[like this]] with be replace with a link to a table of footnotes added to the bottom of the content.

You can also use the functions footnote_list and footnote_content to grab the list and anchored content separately if you want to use them in a template file rather than adding the textformatter to a field.

It was put together quickly for a project a while back so it has some markup in that you might want to change to suit if you use it. One day I'll try and tidy it up for more general use if anyone thinks it's worth it.
